Code used for classifying Whole Slide Images (WSI) of tumors to decide if they are positive or negative to the brown biomarker PD-L1 (brown staining on the tumor area).

The model developed is diveded in 2 independent parts, Region of Interest (ROI) identification (identify_ROI.ipynb and identify_ROI_normalized.ipynb)
 and PD-L1 classification (base_model.ipynb, base_model_bins.ipynb, logistic_regression.pynb, SVM.pynb, decision_tree.ipynb and randomforest.ipynb).
 The notebooks contain portions of code both for training the models and for testing it.
